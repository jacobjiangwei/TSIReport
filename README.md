Open Test.workspaceï¼Œ compile dynamicframework target in arm64 iOS device target mode.
Compile it and checkout dynamic framework.framework.

Use command line:
nm DynamicFramework 

0000000000007e64 t -[UseStaticLibrary test]
0000000000007f80 S _DynamicFrameworkVersionNumber
0000000000007f40 S _DynamicFrameworkVersionString
                 U _OBJC_CLASS_$_NSObject

We can see symbols of test1,test2,test3 are all there.
I already turn on Link Time Optimization, which means only test2 should be there, we shouldn't link test1,test3.

The same result happens when we use testApp link against static library. The symbols are still there, not strip or optimized.


However If we open macLibrary folder, open Untitiled.xcworkspace.
Compile mac command line and net.framework, they both link against net-static library and only called ffffff2 function.
after compile and use command line : nm    check those target symbols.

Turns out mac command line was able to optimized unused function and net.framework can't.

above document we tried, also works, but why it doesn't work in xcode ios app and framework, mac framework, only works in mac command line executable app?
